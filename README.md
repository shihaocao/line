# Line

## 11/03
I want to animate a line tracing itself out, I think it will look pretty.

Here is my first pass, I used used a particle like physics model, orbiting the origin dependent on gravity plus acceleration. It is too orbit like, also there is some clipping glitch somewhere.

I figured out orbit controls in pygame + pyopengl. This makes me trumendously happy, and thank goodness I dont have to do anything related to three js.
