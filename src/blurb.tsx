        <h2>Listen to the Line</h2>
        <p>In late 2024, I went to a Porter Robinson concert, and there was a line that was moving and shimmering that really captivated me.
        The beauty of line was fragile, and it reminded me of how delicate the moment was. Each moment of the line was unique -- emphemerality is it's beauty.
        I knew then that I wanted to be able to capture that feeling and recreate it.</p>

        <p>In homage to the Three Body Problem, I knew that was what I wanted as the underlying physics driving the simulation. Everything else followed trying to pursue two more principles:
        <ul>
        <li> How can I make the vibes delicate?
        <li> How can the user interact with it?
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>If you haven't already, you can click/drag around. And you're able to drag around the debug opacity that shows you the other bodies of the simulation.</p>

        <p>If you wanted to hear (and see) a bit of what inspired me, here's a clip of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvz-aL3Xyg"> live version of Unfold </a> that really stuck with me.</a>
        <h2>Song Choice</h2>
        <p>I think a core theme about orbiting bodies is that they may get close, but they will never touch. Furthermore, it is very difficult to predict where they may go, or how they will dance.
        The only thing you do know, is that they will dance. I felt that Aaron Richardson's remake of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2fDr2ASQg3fGcsxpTxszK6?si=4298e00004104d2a">As the World Falls Down</a> matches that a bit. It also happened to be added to my spotify liked around when I was adding audio to the project.</p>
