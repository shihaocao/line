            <p>Do you hear the line? What do you see in the song?</p>

            <p>At concerts I pay attention to the visual mixes almost as much as the actual songs themselves, and at Porter Robinson, in late 2024, I was captivated. On screen, a shimmering line spoke to me. I listened to each verse as it sang, and followed its wavering beauty as it traced, and evaporated before eyes. I felt moved by the curves I understood, and yearned to empathize with the movements that were out of reach.</p>

            <p>To me, beauty is composed of the parts we can appreciate and cherish in the moment, and of the mystery and splendor that we are humble enough to ask, to be taught -- will you show me what is special to you? Beauty is how these mix to create the light and dark we see in each other's art.</p>

            <p>And so, with this project, I wanted to find that beauty -- to <em>listen to the line</em>.</p>

            <p>The underlying physics that drive this is a three-body problem, inspired by the Three Body book series. As you may know, the lines will never touch, instead they will always dance. Closer, further, and only time will tell how we dance.</p>

            <p>If you want to visualize the other bodies, you can toggle the settings in the top left.</p>

            <p>I wish you all the best in finding beauty.</p>

                I felt that Aaron Richards's remake of

                describes a wavering dance of two. It also hapened to have just found the soung on Spotify when I was adding audio to the project.
